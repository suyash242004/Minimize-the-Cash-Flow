# Minimize-the-Cash-Flow
In this project, we explore the application of the Greedy algorithm for optimizing cash flow management. The goal is to minimize the total number of transactions required to settle debts among multiple parties. By implementing this approach in Python, we demonstrate an efficient solution for reducing financial overhead in complex scenarios.

1.Identify Net Cash Flow: Calculate the net amount each person/company owes or is owed by summing up all transactions.

2.Apply Greedy Algorithm: Iteratively settle the maximum possible debt by matching the person with the highest positive cash flow with the person with the highest negative cash flow. 

3.Reduce Transactions: Continue the process until all debts are settled with the minimal number of transactions.
