# Minimize-the-Cash-Flow
In this project, we explore the application of the Greedy algorithm for optimizing cash flow management. The goal is to minimize the total number of transactions required to settle debts among multiple parties. By implementing this approach in Python, we demonstrate an efficient solution for reducing financial overhead in complex scenarios.
